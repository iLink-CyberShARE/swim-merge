# SWIM-Merge 
A transformation service to merge workflow model result into a single output response. 

## Features
+ Model-to-model workflow execution metadata
+ Provenance of executed services (modeling and data transformation)
+ Extraction only of outputs of interest defined by user on the SWIM-Broker service.

## Build and Run

### Option 1: Docker Compose File
This setup is recommended for production environment.   

1. Download the docker-composer.yml file to a path in your machine.   
2. Install Docker and Docker composer on your target machine.   
3. Setup your docker account at: https://www.docker.com/get-started   
4. Configure the docker-composer file with your own app settings.   
5. Run docker compose: $docker-compose up   
5a. Use -d option o the composer command to run on the background.    
6. swagger docs will be available at http://localhost:5021/swim-merge/docs/ 

### Option 2: Build Docker Container
This setup is recommended for testing environment.

1. Download this repository into a folder on your machine.
2. Install Docker and Docker composer on your target machine.
3. Setup your docker account at: https://www.docker.com/get-started
4. Using a command line or terminal navigate to the base path of the project.
5. Build the image: $docker build -t dockeruser/swim-merge:latest .
6. Run the container: $docker run -p dockeruser/swim-merge
7. Swagger docs available at http://localhost:5003/swim-merge/docs/ 

### Option 3: Native
This setup is recommended for development environment.    

1. Install Python 3 and pip on your machine.
2. Create new virtual python environment: $py -m venv env 
3. Activate virtual environment. $env\Scripts\activate
4. Update the pip repository: $update pip
5. Install required packages: $py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Modify the file /app/main/config with your local settings and database connections on the development settings.
6. Run service on localhost: $py manage.py run  // run webservice on localhost (windows)
7. swagger docs will be available at http://localhost:5000/swim-merge/docs/
